\section*{Question \S23-7}
\paragraph{}

Is the space $\R_\ell$ connected? Justify your answer.

\subsection*{Solution}
\paragraph{}

No, $\R_\ell$ is not connected. To see this consider the open sets formed by fixing $b$ in $\R_\ell$

\begin{eqnarray*}
U_1 = \bigcup_{x<b}[x,b) = (-\infty, b) \\
U_2 = \bigcup_{b<x}[b,x) = [b,\infty).
\end{eqnarray*}

The sets $U_1 \tand U_2$ clearly form a separation of $\R_\ell$.

\section*{Question \S23-11}
\paragraph{}
Let $p:X \to Y$ be a quotient mp. Show that if each set $p^{-1}(\set{y})$ is connected, and if $Y$ is connected, then $X$ is connected.

\subsection*{Solution}
\paragraph{}

Suppose $X$ is not connected, let $A \tand B$ be a separation of $X$. We will show that $A \tand B$ are saturated with respect to $p$. 

Given any $y \in Y$ the set $p^{-1}(\set{y})$ must lie entirely within $A \tor B$ since $p^{-1}(\set{y})$ is connected. Thus $A$ must contain any set $p^{-1}(\set{y})$ that it intersects. Likewise for $B$. Further, note that since $p$ is surjective $p(A) \cup p(B) = Y$ and $p(A) \cup p(B) = \nullset$, otherwise a point in the intersection would have pre-image lying in both $A \tand B$. Since $p$ takes saturated open sets of $X$ to open sets in $Y$, $p(A) \tand p(B)$ are open and thus form a separation of $Y$, a contradiction.

\section*{Question \S28-3}
\paragraph{}

Let $X$ be limit point compact.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
If $f:X \to Y$ is continuous, does it follow that $f(X)$ is limit point compact?
\item
If $A$ is a closed subset of $X$, does it follow that $A$ is limit point compact?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution (a)}
\paragraph{}
 
Yes, $f(X)$ is limit point compact. Suppose $A \subset f(X)$ and $A$ has infinitely man points. Then $f^{-1}(A)$ has infinitely many points and so has a limit point in $X$, say $x$. Then there exists a net in $f^{-1}(A)$, say $\set{x_\lambda}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ such that $x_\lambda \to x$. By continuity of $f$, $f(x_\lambda \to f(x)$, thus $f(x)$ is a limit point of $A$.

\subsection*{Solution (b)}
\paragraph{}

Yes, $A$ is limit point compact. If $A$ is closed then $A$ contains all of it's limit points. Given $B$, an infinite subset of $A$, $B$ has a limit point in $X$, being an infinite subset of $X$. But since $B \subset A$ this limit point must lie within $A$. Thus $A$ is limit point compact.
