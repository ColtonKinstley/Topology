\section*{Question 2}
Let $X$ be a metric space with metric d; let $A \subset X$ be nonempty.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Show that \dots
\item
Show that if $A$ is compact, $d(x,A) = d(x,a) $ for some $a \in A$.
\item
Define the \dots
\item
Assume that $A$ is compact; let $U$ be and open set containing $A$. Show that some $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $A$ is contained in $U$. 
\item
Show the result in (d) need not hold if $A$ is closed but not compact.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution (b)}
Since $d: X \times X \to \R$ is continuous its restriction to $X \times A$ is also continuous. Fixing $x \in X$ we minimize the continuous function $d \big \vert_A:A \to \R$ to obtain the value of $d(x,A)$. Because $A$ is compact we can apply theorem 27.4 [Munkres]  (the extreme value theorem) to obtain $c \in A$ such that $d(x,c) \leq d(x,a)$ for all $a \in A$. Hence the infimum in the definition of $d(x,A)$ is in fact obtained by $c \in A$ and $d(x,A) = d(x,c)$.

\subsection*{Solution (d)}
Since $U$ is an open set in $X$ we have that for each $a \in A \subset U$ there is a basis element $B_d(a,\epsilon)$ with $\epsilon$ depending on $a$ that is a subset of $U$. This set of balls forms an open cover of $A$ and because $A$ is compact there exists $\set{B_d(a_i,\epsilon_i)}_{i=1}^n$ a finite subcover. Let $\epsilon = \min_{i=1, \dots, n} \set{ \epsilon_i}$ then we have $U(A,\epsilon) = \bigcup_i B_d(a_i,\epsilon_i) \subset U$, since for each $i = 1, \dots, n$

\[
B_d(a_i,\epsilon) \subset B_d(a_i,\epsilon_i) \subset U.
\]

\subsection*{Solution (e)}
Take $(X,d)$ = $\R \times \R$ with the usual metric. Let $A = [1,\infty) \times \set{0}$. Then an open set containing $A$ is $U = (0,\infty) \times \R \cap \set{(x,y) \st x>0, -e^{-x} < y < e^{-x}}$.

Suppose that there were an $\epsilon > 0$ such that $U(A,\epsilon) \subset U$. Then the point $(1-\ln{\epsilon}, \epsilon / 2)$ would lie in $U(A,\epsilon)$ but if $U(A,\epsilon) \subset U$ this implies that

\begin{equation*}
\epsilon/2 < e^{-(1-\ln{\epsilon})} = \epsilon/e 
\end{equation*}
a contradiction.

\section*{Question 10}

Show that if $X$ is a countable product of spaces having countable dense subsets, then $X$ has a countable dense subset.

\subsection*{Solution}

Let $X = \prod_{i=1}^\infty X_i$ be a countable product of spaces and suppose for each $i = 1, \dots, n$ $A_i \subset X_i$ is a countable dense subset. We can show that $X$ has a countable dense subset by constructing one. Let $A = \prod_{i=1}^\infty A_i$, we will show that $A$ is a countable dense subset of $X$. That $A$ is countable is clear as it is the countable product of countable sets. To see that $A$ is dense in $X$ we apply theorem 19.5 [Munkres] to see that

\begin{equation*}
\bar{A} = \overline{\prod_iA_i} = \prod_i \bar{A_i} = \prod_i X_i = X.
\end{equation*}
